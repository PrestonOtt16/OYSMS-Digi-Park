This is a Univerity of Texas at San Antonio Senior Design Project completed on the date of 4/23/2024
Group members: Preston Ott, Josh Swanner, Joshua Moya, Younes Younes, Luis Santillian

The projects goal was too make an app that displays a parking lot map showing which parking spaces are occupied/unoccupied for navigation purposes. 

The projects detailed goal was to create a wireless sensor system that will scan a parking lot.
The scan will be fed to a machine learning model that detects if parking spaces are occupied or not.
The machine learning model will send the parking space data to a server hosting a mobile app.
The mobile app will use the data to create and display a map of the parking lot to the mobile app user.
The mobile app user will use the map too find the nearest unoccupied parking space.
